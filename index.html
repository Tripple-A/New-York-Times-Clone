                <div class="youtube-text">
                       <p class="youtube-text"> Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.<br><br>

                        “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
                         ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email.<br><br>
                        
                        Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. 
                        “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.<br><br>
                        
                        By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
                         spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.<br><br>
                         Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email,
                          “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest 
                          discoveries in the history of science.” <br><br>

John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
 called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed.
  “I think the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said.<br><br>

Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation
 that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis,
  said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, 
  but he expressed reservations about inflation.<br><br>

Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
 noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the 
 cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions 
 about the universe. <br><br>

“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said. <br><br>

Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft 
will report its own findings this year. 
At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements
 from balloons, mountaintops and space.<br><br>

<b>Spirals in the Sky</b>
<br><br>

Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out
 of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally 
 by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize. <br><br>

Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four 
leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes 
at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others 
are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the
 California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
 <br><br>
 “The South Pole is the closest
  you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, 
  he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.<br><br>

 In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the
  microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a 
  slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.<br><br>

This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational 
waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and 
stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization
 of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the
  sky should have little arrows going in spirals. <br><br>

Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally
 small differences in the temperature of the microwaves.
  The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.<br><br>

“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.<br><br>

The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a
 year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had
  things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.<br><br>

<b>A Special Time</b><br><br>

The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like
 Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a
  special break point in the evolution of the universe.<br><br>

  Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today
  : gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces.
   But they have long suspected that those are simply different 
   manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe 
   in its earliest, hottest moments.<br><br>

As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace,
 like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other.
  The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.<br><br>

That was where Dr. Guth came in.<br><br>

Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature 
falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze,
 releasing latent heat.<br><br>

Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. 
In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.<br><br>

Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind 
of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself 
supplying the repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart<br><br>

What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
 trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of 
 a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.<br><br>

Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and
 radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s
  observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across.
   “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes
    to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”<br><br>
    Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from
     Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation,
     once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a 
     comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, 
     spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.<br><br>

So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, 
but do not bother asking about going any deeper into the past.<br><br>

We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, 
because inflation erases everything that came before it. 
All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, 
forever out of our view.<br><br>

“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, 
a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team,
 “you wind up at inflation.”<br>
